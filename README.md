# Rendusa
Open Source 3D Media Player

See in action at
http://rendusa.com

## Installing / Getting started

TODO - More info coming soon.

## Developing

TODO - More info coming soon.

### Deploying / Publishing

Rendusa is primarily designed to be a part of Drupal using it's own Drupal 
module, but this is not required. The module is designed for Drupal 7.

The Renudsa Drupal module requires:
jQuery Update module
ffmpeg - installed on the Drupal server and available to PHP

## Features

Rendusa 
* Rendusa's primary design goal was to play lists of 2D+Z videos and images 
in various 3D output formats to support a larger possible audience to view 
the 3D sources.

* Rendusa is not just a media player for your site. It was designed with a 
Drupal module as well to allow uploading of supported media.

* Rendusa is modular. Don't like the user interface? Write your own and 
exchange the default one with yours.

* All of the input format handlers can be excluded if not needed simply by 
omitting them from the source list. Custom handlers can be added the same 
way.
